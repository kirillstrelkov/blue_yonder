# Solution for test from Blue Yonder

## Task

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
* http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
* http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
* http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a script that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images, storing them on the local hard disk.
Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal dayâ€™s work.
Imagine this code will be used in important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.

We prefer Python, but you can choose any programming language you like (e.g Java, Python, or C++).
