TEST:

A) Do you have any code projects that you are willing to share with us, that demonstrates your programming or software engineer capabilities?
For example, is there any open source project that you have recently contributed to that we can take a look at?
We prefer Python, but any other programming language is fine as well (e.g Java, Python, or C++).

B) As a step of the Blue Yonder hiring process, we kindly ask applicants to hand in a solution to the small programming task below.
For us, this includes appropriate unit tests and the application of clean code principles.
We value both technical correctness and coding style.
Please be assured that there is no time limit, so you are free to tackle this task whenever it suits you best.
Enjoy coding, we are looking forward to receive your response.
If we like your solution, we will invite you for interviews, where we will also talk with you about your code.
Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a script that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images, storing them on the local hard disk.
Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal dayâ€™s work.
Imagine this code will be used in important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.

We prefer Python, but you can choose any programming language you like (e.g Java, Python, or C++).
